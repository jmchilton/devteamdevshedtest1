# This is a three column tab separated file to define the properties
# file (settings) to be offered for Blast2GO for Pipelines (b2g4pipe).
#
# Column 1 - ID, string that Galaxy will save in its database
# Column 2 - Human readable name, Galaxy will show this in the UI
# Column 3 - Filename, Galaxy will use this when calling the tool
#
# Probably the most important setting in the properties file is the
# Blast2GO database to use. Currently b2g4pipe v2.3.5 ships with an
# old configuration so consult http://blast2go.org for the latest
# public database they host in Spain. We also strongly recommend
# configuring a local Blast2GO database.
